In this notebook, we will focus on teaching you the basics of writing queries against single tables. In 102, we will show you more advanced querying techniques that will enable you to answer more complex, multi-step questions. And in 103, you'll learn how to combine data from multiple tables to enrich your queries - but we will walk before we run."

It's like a light switch that can either be on (true) or off (false), and it's used in computing to make decisions based on these binary conditions. These are the same conditions used when filtering data. It is used extensively in coding and analytics, so it is crucial to understand at least the basics.
